  <h4>Features:</h4>
  <p>“This forest is preserved through the care and foresight of Dick Bonier and his family,” is inscribed on Dick’s
    bench, celebrating the Bonier family’s gift in 2018. For over fifty years, Dick Bonier walked a daily morning path
    through this beautiful 20-acre fragment of the oak history forest that used to cover most of New England. AVIS has
    improved and added to the loop trail, constructing boardwalks to allow casual visitors to stroll through the partly
    wetland forest that features majestic pine, birch, shagbark hickory, ironwood, maple, oak, fern, wintergreen, skunk
    cabbage, and other species.</p>

  <p> This loop trail is filled with contrasting textures: the moist soil underfoot, the mosses and ferns along the
    trail, the shaggy shagbark hickory bark, the smooth gray “muscles” of the ironwood trunks, and the delicate curls of
    birch bark. The dying white ash trees along the trail show damage from the Emerald ash borer, an invasive insect
    that is killing ash trees across the country. As you look, you’ll see that woodpeckers have peeled back sections of
    bark, exposing the bore-holes that these insects leave behind. Dying trees create an opening in the tree canopy,
    allowing more light to reach the soil and begin the cycle of regrowth. </p>

  <p> Dick’s Trail is accessible from Monahan Lane, where there is ample parking at the trailhead. The path follows a
    bubbling stream as it falls northwest and downhill towards the Merrimack River. Some edges of the reservation are
    still lined by the centuries-old stone walls built when the land was likely part of the historic Bailey farm. At the
    furthest reach, where the stream passes out of the reservation, is a large, flat granite boulder that bears marks of
    the ancient iron “plug and feather” method of rock quarrying used when West Andover farms were settled during the
    eighteenth century. The gift of this healthy forest, given within Dick Bonier’s lifetime, was the result of his
    planning for many decades and suggestions from Harold Rafton.
