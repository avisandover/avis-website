  <h3>COVID-19 Advisory</h3>
  <hr>
  
  <h4>To all friends of AVIS and our valued Andover open spaces:</h4>
  <br>
  <p>
    Advice from the Andover Board of Health. “The Governor’s advisory to stay home allows for taking walks 
    outdoors; residents are encouraged to get some fresh air daily, while keeping a safe distance from each other. 
    Popular public trail systems have been overwhelmed, making it difficult to maintain the 6’ separation; 
    residents are encouraged to seek out lesser used trails, and bypass those that appear to have a lot of 
    cars in the parking lot.” 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Thank you for all your support over the years. That support allows AVIS to have reservations available 
    for use by the public. In this stressful time we know that a walk outside is good for our health.  
  </p>
  
  <p>Here is a link to all AVIS reservations: <a href="/reservations.html">link</a></p>

  <p>You can also get a link to Town Conservation Land and other trails by going to the Andover Trails 
      Committee website at:  <a href="https://www.andovertrails.org/our-trails.html">https://www.andovertrails.org/our-trails.html</a></p>

   <p>Parking capacity at AVIS’ most popular reservations has been overwhelmed, especially at Goldsmith Woodlands.  
       We ask that you seek less used reservations, especially if you can walk to them from your home.  If 
       the parking lot is full at the reservation of your choice, please seek another destination.  When you 
       walk, please follow the CDC advice to maintain at least a 6 foot distance from anyone not a member of your 
       own immediate household.  Do wash your hands when you return home.</p>

    <p>If each of us takes precautions and stays healthy we will help protect those we love, especially our more 
        vulnerable senior citizens and residents with medical conditions.</p>
