  <h3>COVID 19 AND ANDOVER OPEN SPACE</h3>
  <hr>
  
  <h4>To all friends of AVIS and our valued Andover open spaces:</h4>
  <br>
  <p>
    The Andover open spaces, whether owned by the Town or AVIS (Andover Village Improvement Society), 
    provide a welcome and healthy distraction from our COVID quarantine.  We are pleased that so 
    many people are finding the lands to be of comfort and for exercise, but the lands have become 
    crowded, the parking lots are more than full, and dogs have been unleashed and pooping everywhere.  
    AVIS and the Town do NOT want to close the lands.<br/><br/>
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-decoration: underline;">
    To keep these lands open, please respect the following regulations:  <br/><br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="text-decoration: underline;">Social Distancing:</font>  Please keep at least 6 feet of 
    distance between you and others.  And wear a mask.<br/><br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="text-decoration: underline;">Parking:</font>  If the lots are full, go and find another 
    beautiful reservation or trail! Most people in Andover live within a 10-minute walk of a reservation 
    or trail. Check out all the open spaces on Andovertrails.org.<br/><br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="text-decoration: underline;">Dogs:</font>  Your dog must be leashed according to the 
    laws of Andover.  It is important to keep the dog on a leash of no more than 6 feet.  You MUST 
    clean up and take your dogâ€™s poop home.  Do you let your children poop in the woods?<br/><br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="text-decoration: underline;">Runners:</font>  Please step well off the trail when 
    you pass someone or wait for them to pass.  You are the youngest and healthiest.  The extent of 
    your exhale could be as much as 32 feet! Citation : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.urbanphysics.net/Social%20Distancing%20v20_White_Paper.pdf">link</a><br/><br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font style="text-decoration: underline;">Trash:</font>  Bring it in; bring it out!  Please leave no trace.<br/><br/>
  </p>
