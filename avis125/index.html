                            <h2>AVIS 125th Year Anniversary</h2>
                            <p>In 2019 the Andover Village Improvement Society (AVIS) is celebrating its 125th 
                                    anniversary with a year-long offering of specially crafted events to involve 
                                    townspeople and many others. AVIS is the second oldest land trust in the country 
                                    and has been protecting open space in Andover for the enjoyment of all.  We recently 
                                    purchased 26 acres along the Merrimack River (2017) and had 20 acres donated (2018)
                                     bringing the total land that AVIS protects to over 1300 acres.  Please join us in 
                                     2019 at one or more of our events to celebrate the preservation of wildlife habitat, 
                                     protection of water resources, and the chance for all to enjoy these hills, woods, and waterways.
