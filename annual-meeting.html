                                We look forward to your participation in the virtual Andover Village Improvement

                                AVIS president, John Hess, will lead the meeting, which will provide information on the 
                                activities and accomplishments of AVIS over the last year, including its care for 
                                more than 25 Andover reservations.  AVIS renewing trustees will also be elected 
                                during the meeting. <br/><br/>

                                AVIS is thrilled to announce several special presentations.  This will include short 
                                films about Boy Scout projects on AVIS reservations and a featured talk on the Turtle 
                                Mound focusing on research conducted by historian and author Jim Gage. <br/> <br/>

                                To cap off the evening, John will offer up a special virtual toast.  Please join us 
                                in toasting with your favorite beverage.  For those interested in joining in with
