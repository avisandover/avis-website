            Art Along the Trails is a celebration of 125 years of AVIS preserving wildlife habitats and water resources
            while providing free access to hills, woods and waterways for Andover residents and visitors. Art and nature
            bring beauty into our lives, inspire us with wonder and curiosity and spark our imaginations and creativity.
            By sharing our creativity with each other in the natural environment, we honor the gifts we receive from it.
            <br /><br />
            In April, individual artists, collaborative artists, students and community groups were invited to submit
            artwork for consideration. As the first collaboration between AVIS and AACA, artists were encouraged to
            consider how the natural world informs their art and how their art compliments the natural world with
            particular
            emphasis on AVIS' trails. We are excited to share that all 12 project proposals were approved and are being
            installed across the AVIS trail network in June. They include a mixture of sculptures, photography,
            interactive
            installations, and workshops. All projects will be removed by September 15, 2019, unless otherwise noted.
