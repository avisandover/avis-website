                <h1>Confronting Racism</h1>
          
                <p>Like many of you, we are appalled by the injustices and acts of violence against 
                  racially marginalized groups. The events that have unfolded in the past weeks and 
                  months shake us all. The murders of unarmed black people over decades, and the 
                  recent protests (that have followed), illustrate the historic, systemic racism and 
                  environmental injustice that exists in our country towards people of color, 
                  especially Black and Brown people.</p>

                <p>
                  Advice from the Andover Board of Health. “The Governor’s advisory to stay home allows for taking 
                  walks outdoors; residents are encouraged to get some fresh air daily, while keeping a safe distance 
                  from each other. Popular public trail systems have been overwhelmed, making it difficult to maintain 
                  the 6’ separation; residents are encouraged to seek out lesser used trails, and bypass those 
                  having a lot of cars in the lot.”
