              <h1>About</h1>

              <p>Founded in 1894 as The Andover Village Improvement Society, AVIS is one of the oldest land
                conservation organizations in the country. AVIS manages more than 30 reservations comprising
                more than 1,200 acres in the Town of Andover. It relies on a corps of volunteers to lead the
                organization and to provide maintenance of its recreational trails and stewardship for the
                land and its wildlife habitat. Donations from community members and grant sources provide the
                funds to acquire, protect and manage its reservations.

              <h1>Confronting Racism</h1>

              <p>Like many of you, we are appalled by the injustices and acts of violence against
                racially marginalized groups. The events that have unfolded in the past weeks and
                months shake us all. The murders of unarmed black people over decades, and the
                recent protests (that have followed), illustrate the historic, systemic racism and
                environmental injustice that exists in our country towards people of color,
                especially Black and Brown people.</p>

              <h1>COVID-19 Advisory</h1>

              <p>
                Advice from the Andover Board of Health. “The Governor’s advisory to stay home allows for taking
                walks outdoors; residents are encouraged to get some fresh air daily, while keeping a safe distance
                from each other. Popular public trail systems have been overwhelmed, making it difficult to maintain
                the 6’ separation; residents are encouraged to seek out lesser used trails, and bypass those
                having a lot of cars in the lot.”

              <h1>AVIS Land Acknowledgement </h1>

              <p>We acknowledge that AVIS reservations are located on the ancestral land of the Pennacook, Pawtucket and
                other Indigenous people,
                which was their home for more than 10,000 years. We honor the land we manage and all the Indigenous
                people who were here before, are here now, and will be here in the future.
                We recognize that we are all guests on this land and are mindful of our impact.
                With this acknowledgement, we commit to continuously care for this land,
                using sustainable practices to protect the environment and provide stewardship for the ecology and
                habitat of AVIS reservations. </p>
