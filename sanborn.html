  <h3>Sanborn Reservation</h3>
  <hr>

  <h4>Features:</h4>
  <p>This reserve contains a pine grove, numerous interesting tree specimens as well as a marsh. Its location along the
    Shawsheen River and away from homes makes it an ideal natural habitat for birds and wildlife.</p>

  <h4>History:</h4>
  <p>The original 14.5 acres was a gift from George K. and Frances Sanborn in 1959. George was an AVIS trustee at the
    time and provided this gift as an incentive for others to donate land. An additional one-half acre on the east bank
    of the Shawsheen between the original parcel and Route 93 was purchased by AVIS in 1966. An additional AVIS purchase
    of 11 acres in 2015 provided road access to the property that formerly could only be reached by water. With this
    additional land the Meg Batcheller trail was created connecting through the Town Conservation Commissionâ€™s Lightning
    Tree reservation. An improved parking area was added in 2017.</p>

  <h4>The Shawsheen River Greenway Dedication:</h4>
  <p>In April, 2016, as result of collaboration between AVIS and the Conservation Commission we <a
      href="/events.html">celebrated the creation</a> of the Meg Batcheller trail through the Sanborn and Lightning Tree
    Reservations.</p>
