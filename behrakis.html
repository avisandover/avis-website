  <h3>Behrakis Reservation</h3>
  <hr>

  <h4>Features:</h4>
  <p>This beautiful collection of reservations is home to many beautiful hemlock groves, horsetail, an open meadow, and
    high
    bluffs. Filled with birches and wildflowers, the riverside trails encompass the Indigenous history of Andover as
    well.
    Long before European settlers came to Andover, the Pennacook Native Americans settled up and down the Merrimack
    River,
    fishing and hunting game. A Pennacook village was located on Pine Island and burial grounds have been found near the
    riverbank. Local Native American artifacts can be seen at the Phillips Academy Peabody Museum. This reservation is
    rich
    with history, and is great for understanding how our current town and land conservation organizations came to be.
