  <h4>Features:</h4>
  <p>More than 145 species of birds, including herons, migrating ducks and nesting Canadian geese, have been observed in
    Bakerâ€™s Meadow. The wetlands also provide vital habitat for muskrat, mink and beaver (see beaver lodge in picture
    below).</p>

  <h4>History:</h4>
  <p>Baker's Meadow, really a pond, was named for Dr. Symonds Baker, who owned most of the area during the late 18th and
    early 19th centuries. During the 1920s when muskrat fur was in fashion, Alexander Henderson dammed his land here to
    form a pond for his muskrats. He was wiped by the 1929 crash, but he maintained the area for small birds and
    animals. In 1958, Harold Rafton, a tireless conservationist, persuaded the Hendersons to sell their land to AVIS.
