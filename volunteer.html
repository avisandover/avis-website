  <h3>Volunteer Opportunities</h3>
  <hr>
  
  <p>There are volunteer opportunities for people to be involved in a number of areas.</p>
  <p>AVIS is currently (June 2015) seeking volunteers for two important activities - we are starting a Technology Committee to help improve our use of new technologies for communication with our members and users, to update the website, and to digitize our trail map. We also seek Kiosk Wardens to help update the kiosks that have been constructed at trail heads.</p>
  
  <div class="lists">
    <p>AVIS wardens need volunteers on a regular basis to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Help with work parties on the reservations</li>
      <li>Clear trails in the spring</li>
      <li>Trim invasive plants in the fall</li>
