  <h3>Deer Hunting Policy</h3>
  <hr>
  
  <p><strong>Deer Hunting is allowed on certain AVIS Reservations During Bow Hunting Season</strong></p>
  
  <p>The AVIS Board of Trustees believes that it is in the best interest of all conservation land in Andover to reduce and control the population of deer in our area. In support of that, we have agreed to join the Andover Conservation Commission's annual deer hunting program. Hunting will be allowed on some of our reservations each year. Information on participating in this program can be found <a href="http://andoverma.gov/conservation/deerhunt.php" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  
  <p>This program is well supervised and has had a perfect safety record. Any reservation where hunting is allowed will be posted at all trailheads. Other allowed uses of our reservations are not prohibited during hunting season. It is always wise to dress with some sort of high-visibility clothing anywhere in the woods during hunting season.</p>
  
  <p>No hunting is allowed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on Sundays.</p>
