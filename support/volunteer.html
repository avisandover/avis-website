  <h3>Volunteer Policies</h3>
  <hr>

  <p>
    Thank you for your interest in volunteering for AVIS. Your participation, as well as the
    participation of countless other volunteers, is vital to AVIS’s success. The following
    policies and waiver are intended to make this volunteer experience safe and rewarding
    for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Description:</b> The Andover Village Improvement Society, AVIS, is a non-profit land trust
    dedicated to land conservation. AVIS encourages the public use of our land including
    passive recreation. Throughout its 125+ year history, AVIS has also encouraged
    volunteer participation in clean-ups, trail construction, and maintenance of its 30
    reservations. Volunteers, such as rangers, the wardens of those reservations, scouts,
    college students, and others have participated in these clean-ups and have also invested
    countless hours in the maintenance of trails. Trail maintenance includes such activities
    as brush cutting, moving stones, and constructing wooden walkways through wet areas.
    Clean-ups may involve lifting heavy and light objects, raking, picking up broken glass,
    and invasive plant eradication.<br /><br />

    <b>Project direction:</b> In most cases, you will work under the direction of a "work party
    leader” who will be a designated AVIS volunteer who will explain the job to you and
    point out areas of special concern. You are not permitted to do any work except under
    the direction of and in the presence of a “work party leader”.<br /><br />

    Only AVIS volunteers who are trained to carry out specific longer-term tasks may work
    on their own without a work party leader. Examples are Wardens who maintain a
    reservation, Scouts who work on approved special projects, and “Weed Warriors” who
    pull invasive plants.<br /><br />

    <b>Tools:</b> AVIS seeks to provide appropriate tools and gloves to carry out these tasks and
    discourages the use of power tools during clean-ups. You may not use power
    equipment unless authorized by your leader. Your leader may authorize you to use
    power equipment if you have demonstrated competence in the use of the tool, have
    knowledge of safety procedures and are equipped with appropriate safety equipment. If you are unfamiliar with the
    safe and proper use of tools needed for your job, ask your
    leader for assistance and do not use the tools until you have done so.
    Fitness: Volunteer work often requires strenuous physical activity. AVIS cannot be
    expected to be aware of, or responsible for, particular medical or physical conditions
    that may create health risks for a volunteer while participating in an AVIS activity. It is
    your responsibility to make sure that you are in sufficiently good physical condition to
    perform the tasks for which you have volunteered without risk to your health. Under no
    circumstances should you arrive for a volunteer assignment impaired by drugs or
    alcohol.<br /><br />

    <b>Illness/Accidents:</b> If you become ill or are injured while you are on duty as a volunteer
    or if you should accidentally damage property or equipment or cause an injury while
    performing your duties, notify your leader and appropriate authorities immediately. You
    should not come to a work party if you are feeling ill or are injured, or if you have been
    exposed to anybody suspected of being infected or potentially infected with the Novel
    Coronavirus or having any symptoms of COVID-19.<br /><br />

    <b>Protection of Children:</b>> Children often participate in AVIS events, programs or activities.
    AVIS’s policy is that no volunteer shall work with an unattended child without another
    volunteer being present. An “unattended child” is a child under 18 who is not in the
    company of a parent or other adult family member. If your volunteer assignment
    involves working directly with children, AVIS may wish (but is not obligating itself) to
    perform a background check from criminal history and sex offender data bases. In such
    case, AVIS will ask you to supply sufficient personal information so that we may conduct
    such a background check.<br /><br />

    <b>Hazards:</b> Clean-ups and trail construction/maintenance activities are often carried out
    on uneven terrain, often in remote locations. Injuries, including trips and falls or slips
    and falls, may result. Broken glass can also cause injury. Trail
    construction/maintenance or other activities may involve the use of hand tools or
    power tools which can also cause injury. Invasive plants may grow amidst poison ivy
    and thorny brush which can cause rash or abrasions. Protective clothing is advised.
    Thank you for your support of AVIS and for your help in keeping our reservations open
    to the public.<br /><br />
