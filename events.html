							2017 Annual Meeting<br>

							Old Town Hall, 20 Main Street, Andover
						</td>
						<td><strong>AVIS Annual Dinner and Meeting: </strong> Guest Speaker - Rusty Russell, Director of the Merrimack River Watershed Council. Topic: <em>Strangers in a Strange Land—Habitat and Water Conservation at the Dawn of a New Era</em>  <a href="assets/docs/Rusty Russell-slides-4-5-17-as_delivered.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>(Slides... PDF)</strong></a>  Mr. Russell recounted the river's major triumphs over the past four decades citing the extensive improvement in water quality (MRWC was founded in 1976, the year Jimmy Carter became president). He also highlighted some of the major threats the river continues to face, some of which are likely to intensify in the coming decades with cuts in financing for programs. He pointed to two important risks the river faces, combined sewer overflow and extensive pollution from storm water runoff. Mr. Russell concluded by saying that the MRWC will begin a water quality testing program once the funding is identified. See photo below.
