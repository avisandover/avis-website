						<td><strong>It’s Spring and everything is waking up! </strong>A one-hour naturalist-led hike for little kids (4-7) with a grownup. Rain date, April 22nd. We will meet at the West Parish Church parking lot, 129 Reservation Road, Andover. We will take a peek at the children’s garden to see if any spring flowers are blooming yet. Then we’ll walk along the trail to West Parish Meadow and look for signs of spring:  nests, animal foods, footprints, bird calls, special smells, eggshells, and other surprises our young detectives can find. This will be a fun short hike at an easy pace.  Questions? Contact <a href="mailto:amy.janovsky@gmail.com" target="_blank">amy.janovsky@gmail.com</a><br>

							Old Town Hall, 20 Main Street, Andover

						<td><strong>AVIS Annual Dinner and Meeting: </strong> Guest Speaker - Rusty Russell, Director of the Merrimack River Watershed Council. Topic: <em>Strangers in a Strange Land—Habitat and Water Conservation at the Dawn of a New Era</em>  <a href="assets/docs/Rusty Russell-slides-4-5-17-as_delivered.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>(Slides... PDF)</strong></a>  Mr. Russell recounted the river's major triumphs over the past four decades citing the extensive improvement in water quality (MRWC was founded in 1976, the year Jimmy Carter became president). He also highlighted some of the major threats the river continues to face, some of which are likely to intensify in the coming decades with cuts in financing for programs. He pointed to two important risks the river faces, combined sewer overflow and extensive pollution from storm water runoff. Mr. Russell concluded by saying that the MRWC will begin a water quality testing program once the funding is identified. See photo below.
