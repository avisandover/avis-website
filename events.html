						<td><strong>History and Hiking in Andover: </strong>On Sunday, July 9, 2017, Andover Trails will lead a family-friendly history hike along the surviving route of the original Andover & Wilmington Railroad, constructed in 1835 and in use until 1848, when the line was re-routed to accommodate the new city of Lawrence.  Doug Mitchell and Jane Cairns from the Andover Historical Society will share stories of this early line and its development and operation, as well as more stories from the sandy plains and old gravel pits surrounding Pomps Pond and the Shawsheen River. 
<br><br><p>
Here's a preview of just some of what you will learn:</p>
<p>
Word spread quickly through Andover, on a summer morning in 1836, when the news came that the town’s first train – and only the second in Massachusetts – would be chugging into town that day.  One embankment with a good view of the newly-laid tracks was “black with people, standing as thick as they could,” as most of the town’s population turned out to cheer the arrival of the two-four-wheeled cars, pulled by the “iron horse” named “Andover.”</p>
<p>
Meet at the far end of the roadway at Andover’s Rec Park (approx 165 Abbot Street) at 2 pm to commence a moderately-paced walk of about two miles.  We will finish back at Rec Park in approximately two hours. </p>

						<td><strong>Work Party on Deer Jump Reservation: </strong>If you love nature and want to help, come and be part of an AVIS work party pulling invasive plants on a section of the Deer Jump Reservation. You can sample garlic mustard pesto and help us continue to enhance the biological diversity of this special habitat by removing aggressive invasive plants. We’ll bring large work gloves and loppers. It’s a wooded area, so ticks and poison ivy are present — long sleeves and pants are suggested. Our work over the past few years really shows this year—the native plants are starting to win the battle.<br><br>We’ll meet by the AVIS sign on Nollett Drive, off of River Road.  For more information Amy Janovsky at 978-475-8655.<br>

						<td><strong>AVIS Annual Dinner and Meeting: </strong> Guest Speaker - Rusty Russell, Director of the Merrimack River Watershed Council. Topic: <em>Strangers in a Strange Land—Habitat and Water Conservation at the Dawn of a New Era</em>  <a href="assets/docs/Rusty Russell-slides-4-5-17-as_delivered.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>(Slides... PDF)</strong></a>  Mr. Russell recounted the river's major triumphs over the past four decades citing the extensive improvement in water quality (MRWC was founded in 1976, the year Jimmy Carter became president). He also highlighted some of the major threats the river continues to face, some of which are likely to intensify in the coming decades with cuts in financing for programs. He pointed to two important risks the river faces, combined sewer overflow and extensive pollution from storm water runoff. Mr. Russell concluded by saying that the MRWC will begin a water quality testing program once the funding is identified. See photo below.
