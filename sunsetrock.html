  <h3>Sunset Rock Reservation</h3>
  <hr>
  
  <h4>Features:</h4>
  <p>Sunset Rock, measuring approximately 250 feet above sea level, is just a short distance from the entrance to the reservation. It marks the beginning of a mile of ledge extending parallel to Sunset Rock Road and ending deep in the woods.</p>
  <p>Crevices in the rocks hold sufficient soil to support some trees and shrubs. Ash is the most common tree. Note the tall juniper with its distinctive gray-blue berries.</p>
  <p>The sunset rock ledge is honeycombed with hollows and is perfect for climbing adventures. The view, especially after the leaves have fallen, is lovely. The trails are marked by white rectangles on trees. From the junction near the trail entrance, the left trail leads you over and down the rock and circles back to the entrance of the reservation via either a short or long loop.</p>
