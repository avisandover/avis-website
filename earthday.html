  <h3>EARTH DAY</h3>
  <hr>  
  <br>
  <p>
    Happy Earth Day, today.  Five decades ago, on April 22, 1970, AVIS was a major leader 
    in the first Earth Day in Andover.<br/><br/>

    Led by former AVIS trustee, Tom Cone, biology teacher at Phillips Academy, and student 
    Jamey French, whose dad, Bob French was an AVIS trustee, the student group Andover Ecology 
    Action enlisted hundreds of Andover High students, PA boys and Abbot girls to collect a 
    pile of trash in downtown Andover. The pile reached 12 feet high.<br/><br/>

    That same day, AVIS set up a table downtown to educate townspeople on critical environmental 
    problems including the need for clean air and clean water and the need to ban poisonous 
    pesticide. This education effort resulted in local shop owners agreeing not to sell the 
    pesticides any longer.<br/><br/>

    Students petitioned their elected officials on teaching environmental education and rights, 
    and opposed an act to shorten the life of forests.<br/><br/>

    Later, in May 1970, AVIS president Nat Smith, PA math teacher, led a major cleanup of the 
    Shawsheen River with the Andover Ecology Action group.<br/><br/>

    So today, Earth Day 50, the AVIS community should take a bow!<br/><br/>
