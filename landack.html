  <h3>AVIS Land Acknowledgement </h3>
  <hr>
  
  <br>
  <p>
    We acknowledge that AVIS reservations are located on the ancestral land of the Pennacook, Pawtucket 
    and other Indigenous people, which was their home for more than 10,000 years. We honor the land we
     manage and all the Indigenous people who were here before, are here now, and will be here in the future. 
     We recognize that we are all guests on this land and are mindful of our impact. With this acknowledgement, 
     we commit to continuously care for this land, using sustainable practices to protect the environment and 
     provide stewardship for the ecology and habitat of AVIS reservations.<br/><br/>
