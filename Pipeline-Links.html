  <h3>Withdrawal of  Natural Gas pipeline update (5/23/2016)</h3>
  <p>
  On April 22, 2016, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company filed a letter with FERC indicating that: "As a result of inadequate capacity commitments from prospective customers and a determination that the Project is uneconomic, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Tennessee's parent company, announced on April 20, 2016 that the company would suspend further work and expenditures on the Project."  Then, on May 23, 2016, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company filed a letter withdrawing its application. AVIS is pleased that it Nat Smith Reservation as well as other conservation land and private homeowners are no longer threatened by this pipeline. AVIS tried to provide information to the public about this project and thanks all those who wrote letters and/or attended meetings.
  </p>

  <h3>Kinder Morgan proposed Natural Gas Pipeline Application (3/26/2016)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The MA Department of Public Utilities is holding a hearing at Andover High School on April 14, 2016, at 7:00 pm. These hearings will help DPU determine whether Kinder Morgan can have access to properties for surveying where the owner has denied permission. These surveys can include heavy trucks accessing the property, removal or trimming of trees, and doing borings to determine soil and subsurface conditions. Please plan to attend to voice your opinion.</li>
    <li>Motions to Intervene were filed before 1/6/16 - AVIS, The Town of Andover, and affected property owners have filed to be Intervenors.</li>
    <li>Kinder Morgan filed their official proposal on 11/20/15 to have their subsidiary, Tennessee Gas Pipeline company, build a 30" pipeline from Wright, NY, to Dracut, MA, and a 24" pipeline (the Lynnfield Lateral) from Dracut through Andover and other eastern MA communities to Danvers, MA.</li>
    <li>This pipeline directly affects the AVIS Nat Smith Reservation and 5 other Town conservation properties as well as over 100 home owners on the Andover Tewksbury border. It will go through many wetlands, under the Merrimack River, and under the Shawsheen River.</li>
    <li>FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, accepted their application on 12/7/15.</li>
    <li>The posting in the Federal Register was on 12/11/15.</li>
    <li>KM has asked for a decision by the 4th quarter of 2016. If so, FERC will need to do a draft EIS by mid June? At one point FERC said they would take at least one year to do a DEIS, so we will see.</li>
    <li>Once the EIS is out there will be more scoping sessions to obtain public input - FERC has continued to say that they allow the market to decide which pipelines succeed (which means - as long as NED has customers in the form of Local Distribution Companies they are not likely to deny KM's request to built this pipeline).</li>
    <li>KM has about 40% of the properties surveyed; they need 100% before they can start.</li>
    <li>Eminent Domain will allow them to do the other surveys-Eminent Domain does not determine route just the price of a taking.</li>
    <li>Note that the docket is now CP16-21.</li>
    <li>An article in the 12/15/15 business section of the <em>Boston Globe</em> talks about KM reducing dividends so they can afford the capital outlay for the NED pipeline. The reporter, like many before him, still says the pipeline goes "...through Southern New Hampshire and Western Massachusetts."  The media often ignore the Laterals in eastern MA which affect many, many people in densely populated areas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Previous Information</h3>
  <p>"As of December 8, 2014, Kinder Morgan has revised the route of this pipeline. There was a major change in the main line from NY to Dracut that moves a large piece of it through New Hampshire. They also made a change to the Lynnfield Lateral that passed through Andover. The lateral no longer goes through any AVIS reservations. It also now avoids the Town water supply at Fish Brook and the Wood Hill and High Plain schools. The proposal is to enter Andover near the power lines at the Franciscan Center on River Road and generally to follow the Andover/Tewksbury border to Wilmington. This route could be changed at any time so AVIS Trustees will continue to monitor this project and will continue to work with the Town on it." The revised map from Kinder Morgan is available at: <a href="http://andoverma.gov/projects/tenngas/altroute111714.pdf">http://andoverma.gov/projects/tenngas/altroute111714.pdf</a></p>
